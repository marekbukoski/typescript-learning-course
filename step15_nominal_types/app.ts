//When comparing types that have 'private' members, we treat these
// differently. For two types to be considered compatible, 
//if one of them has a private member, then the other must have a 
//private member that originated in the same declaration. 
//This allows us to implement Nominative types in TypeScript

//*********************************************************

//Example 2
//Because 'BigAnimal' and 'Rhino' share the private side of their shape from the same declaration of 'private name: string' in 'BigAnimal', 
//they are compatible. However, this is not the case for 'Employee'. When we try to assign from an 'Employee' to 'Animal' we get an error that these types
//are not compatible. Even though 'Employee' also has a private member called 'name', it is not the same one as the one created in 'BigAnimal'.
