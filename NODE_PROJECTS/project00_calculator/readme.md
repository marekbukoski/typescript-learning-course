# Simple Command Line Calculator

Develop a simple command line calculator using [TypeScipt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Create a GitHub repository for the project and submit its URL and NPX command in the project submission form. Please note that you will create a NPX command for your project and publish it on npm. After the NPX command is working you will announce it on Panaverse groups on Facebook, Discord, and Twitter.


## You can develop [CLI Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oHByo8tiEY) using Inquirer, Chalk, etc. All your class projects will be CLI based and should be deployed as an [NPX command](https://blog.deepgram.com/npx-script/)

Run the following command to experience a CLI game:

        npx firequiz

Now review the [source code](https://github.com/fireship-io/javascript-millionaire) for Firequiz game.
