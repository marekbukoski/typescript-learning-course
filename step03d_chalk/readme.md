# Using Inquirer and Chalk to CLI Apps

# Using Inquirer and Chalk Package

The latest version of [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/)(9+) and [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)(5+) have started using Native ECMA Script Packages. 

In most of our projects and assignment we will use these packages.

Give the following command:

        npm i inquirer

        npm i --save-dev @types/inquirer

        npm install chalk

Add .gitignore file and Write your code in app.ts file.

Give the following commands:

        tsc

        node app.js

## You can develop [CLI Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oHByo8tiEY) using Inquirer, Chalk, etc. All your class projects will be CLI based and should be deployed as an [NPX command](https://blog.deepgram.com/npx-script/)

[How to create a NPX tool](https://blog.shahednasser.com/how-to-create-a-npx-tool/)

Run the following command to experience a CLI game:

        npx firequiz
